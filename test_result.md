# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"
##     file: "file_path.py"
##     stuck_count: 0
##     priority: "high"  # or "medium" or "low"

Both components now display 4.47448% from new calculation system with proper fallbacks. Added SYI methodology version badges. Ready for frontend integration testing to verify new SYI values appear correctly in UI."

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

TESTING RESULTS: ✅ Navigation elements present (Peg Monitor link in header found), ✅ Frontend components implemented (PegMonitorPage.js, PegStatusWidget.js exist), ✅ UI structure correct (homepage loads, navigation responsive), ❌ MIXED CONTENT SECURITY BLOCKING API CALLS: Frontend served over HTTPS but making HTTP API calls to backend, browser blocking insecure requests, preventing real peg data from loading. ❌ ROUTING ISSUES: /peg-monitor and /index-dashboard routes redirecting to homepage, preventing access to peg monitoring pages. ✅ FALLBACK MECHANISM WORKING: System gracefully falls back to mock data when API calls fail, UI remains functional with demo data. FRONTEND IMPLEMENTATION STATUS: All components properly coded and integrated, professional UI design with proper styling, responsive design working on mobile/desktop, but BLOCKED by security and routing issues.

          comment: "✅ RISK REGIME INVERSION ALERT SYSTEM FRONTEND INTEGRATION FULLY OPERATIONAL - Comprehensive testing completed with 100% SUCCESS RATE. FRONTEND INTEGRATION VERIFICATION: ✅ Risk Regime Widget properly integrated into Index Dashboard page (/index-dashboard), ✅ 'Risk Regime Inversion Alert' section displays correctly with professional styling, ✅ RiskRegimeWidget component renders perfectly with all technical indicators. API INTEGRATION SUCCESS: ✅ Backend /api/regime/current endpoint working (HTTP 200), ✅ API returns proper regime data: state='NEU', syi_excess=-0.0085, z_score=0, breadth_pct=40, alert_type='Early-Warning', ✅ Frontend processes API responses correctly and displays formatted data. TECHNICAL INDICATORS DISPLAY: ✅ SYI Excess: -85bps (properly formatted in basis points), ✅ Z-Score: 0.00 (decimal format with 2 places), ✅ Momentum: 0bps (basis points format), ✅ Breadth: 40% (percentage format), ✅ Regime State Badge: 'Neutral' with appropriate gray styling, ✅ Color coding working (red for negative SYI Excess, appropriate colors for each indicator). UI/UX FUNCTIONALITY: ✅ Widget displays with professional institutional-grade styling, ✅ Responsive design works correctly on mobile (390x844) and desktop (1920x1080), ✅ Loading states and error handling implemented with graceful fallback to demo data, ✅ Proper icons (Activity icon for Neutral state) and badge styling, ✅ Update timestamp displays correctly ('Updated: 10:03:38 PM'). INTEGRATION WITH EXISTING DASHBOARD: ✅ Risk Regime Widget doesn't break existing functionality, ✅ Index Family section still working properly, ✅ Peg Monitoring section remains functional, ✅ Index Constituents section displays correctly, ✅ Overall page performance maintained. REGIME STATE SCENARIOS: ✅ Neutral state displays correctly with gray styling and Activity icon, ✅ 'Initializing or no clear regime signal' description shown appropriately, ✅ Early-Warning alert type properly indicated. CONCLUSION: Risk Regime Inversion Alert system frontend integration is COMPLETE and FULLY OPERATIONAL. Widget displays realistic regime data with proper formatting, handles API integration seamlessly, maintains professional UI/UX standards, and integrates perfectly with existing dashboard functionality.

          comment: "❌ CRITICAL ROUTING ISSUE PREVENTS TESTING - Live Stablecoin Market Charts component cannot be tested due to fundamental routing issue with /index-dashboard page. COMPONENT STATUS: ✅ StablecoinMarketCharts.js component properly implemented with all 4 tabs (Distribution, Rankings, Yield Trends, Adoption), ✅ Interactive Recharts integration complete, ✅ Export functionality implemented, ✅ Component correctly imported in IndexDashboardPage.js. TESTING FAILURE: ❌ Cannot access /index-dashboard route - browser redirects to homepage, ❌ Component not visible for interaction testing, ❌ Tab switching functionality cannot be verified, ❌ Chart rendering and interactivity cannot be tested, ❌ Export functionality cannot be validated. ROOT CAUSE: Same routing issue affecting SYI Macro Analysis - React Router /index-dashboard route not functioning. The Live Stablecoin Market Charts implementation appears complete but is inaccessible due to the routing problem. IMPACT: User's primary concern about 'Live Index graphs are not shown' and 'switching is not possible' remains unresolved because the entire dashboard page is unreachable."

      message: "🚨 CRITICAL YIELD DATA ISSUE IDENTIFIED - Unrealistic yields (78-81%) from Interest-Curve protocol confirmed. Testing reveals USDC 81.39% and USDT 78.78% yields are being served to users, matching reported '80%' values. ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS: Yield sanitization system exists and is properly configured (reasonable_maximum: 50%, suspicious_threshold: 25%) but NOT being applied in production. All 5 yields show NO sanitization metadata, indicating _apply_yield_sanitization() function in yield_aggregator.py is being bypassed or failing silently. IMPACT: Users seeing unrealistic stablecoin yields that should be 1-15% APY range. IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED: Fix yield sanitization pipeline execution in yield_aggregator.py line 58 to ensure sanitization is actually applied to all yields before serving to users."
