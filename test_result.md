#====================================================================================================

# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"
##     file: "file_path.py"
##     stuck_count: 0
##     priority: "high"  # or "medium" or "low"
##     needs_retesting: false
##     status_history:

## test_plan:
##   current_focus:
##     - "Task name 1"
##     - "Task name 2"

##
## agent_communication:
##     -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"
##     -message: "Communication message between agents"

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

      message: "✅ DEFI INTEGRATION TESTING COMPLETE - 91.3% SUCCESS RATE (21/23 tests passed). CRITICAL DISCOVERY: Fixed major bug in DefiLlama service that was preventing DeFi data integration. DeFi integration now fully operational with real yield data from major protocols. FINDINGS: 1) DefiLlama API accessible and returning 19,315+ pools 2) Successfully retrieving stablecoin yields from DeFi protocols (Interest-Curve, Convex-Finance, Curve-Dex) 3) Real DeFi yields significantly different from fallback data (USDT: 77.99% vs 8.45%, USDC: 80.32% vs 7.82%, DAI: 9.31% vs 6.95%) 4) Complete DeFi metadata available (pool_id, chain, TVL values) 5) Yield aggregator successfully combining DeFi sources (5 DeFi, 0 CeFi) 6) Aave V3 and Compound pools available but not selected due to lower yields vs promotional rates on newer chains. CONCLUSION: DeFi integration is working correctly and providing real decentralized yield data while CeFi remains blocked by jurisdiction restrictions."

      message: "✅ PROTOCOL POLICY SYSTEM (STEP 2) TESTING COMPLETE - 100% SUCCESS RATE. COMPREHENSIVE VERIFICATION: 1) Policy System: v1.0.0 with 9 allowlisted, 4 denylisted protocols. Kraken Staking now allowlisted (FIXED). Reputation threshold 0.70, strict mode enabled. 2) Yield Data Integration: GET /api/yields/ returns 5 filtered yields (no longer empty). All yields include protocol_info metadata with reputation scores. Average reputation 0.77 (above threshold). 3) Policy Filtering: Only allowlisted protocols appear. Denied protocols completely filtered out. Greylist protocols correctly identified. 4) Reputation Scoring: Aave V3: 1.00 (Blue Chip), Compound V3: 0.95 (Blue Chip), Curve: 0.90 (Blue Chip), Kraken Staking: 0.78 (Emerging) - all within expected ranges. CONCLUSION: Protocol curation and institutional-grade filtering working end-to-end. The protocol mapping issues have been resolved and the system is fully operational."

Implemented comprehensive RAY calculator with multi-factor risk assessment (peg stability, liquidity, counterparty, protocol reputation, temporal stability) using compound penalty methodology. Created SYI compositor with TVL-capped weighting, diversification requirements, and institutional-grade quality metrics. Added ray_routes.py with API endpoints: GET /api/ray/methodology, POST /api/ray/calculate, GET /api/ray/market-analysis, GET /api/syi/composition, GET /api/syi/methodology. Registered routes in server.py. System now provides institutional-grade risk-adjusted yield calculations and index composition.
