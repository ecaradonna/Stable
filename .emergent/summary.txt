The AI engineer's work began with foundational fixes and the implementation of a four-index family, integrating real CeFi yield data. This evolved into a sophisticated stablecoin peg monitoring system and a refined StableYield Index (SYI) calculation with dedicated backend services and frontend integration. Subsequently, a critical Risk Regime Inversion Alert module was developed from scratch, encompassing advanced financial calculations, API endpoints, and UI widgets. Extensive UI/UX issues were systematically addressed, including navigation, data display, global scroll-to-top, and, crucially, resolving hardcoded  URLs to enable proper deployment. The most recent phase involved a comprehensive full website redesign, adhering to new brand guidelines, color palettes, and copy. To date, the Homepage, Live Index Dashboard, and Yield Indices & Benchmarks pages have been redesigned, with work progressing on the Peg Monitor page. The overall trajectory demonstrates a strong capability in feature development, bug fixing, and large-scale architectural restructuring.

<product_requirements>
The overarching goal is to establish StableYield.com as the Bloomberg for stablecoin yields, providing data, analytics, and market intelligence.
The user's explicit requests and the resulting product development trajectory include:
1.  **StableYield Index Family (SY100, SY-CeFi, SY-DeFi, SY-RPI)**: A comprehensive index family with methodology, current values, mode, constituents, and TVL.
2.  **Real-time CeFi Yield Data**: Integration of Coinbase API to replace mock data for SY-CeFi.
3.  **Stablecoin Peg Monitoring System**: A modular Python package () for multi-source price fetching, peg deviation analysis, exposed via CLI and FastAPI.
4.  **Frontend for Peg Monitoring**: Dedicated Peg Monitor dashboard and a Peg Status widget on the Index Dashboard.
5.  **Refined StableYield Index (SYI) Calculation**: A new, specific weighted average calculation of Risk-Adjusted Yields (RAY), with strict validation and API endpoints for calculation, history, and upsert.
6.  **Risk Regime Inversion Alert Module**: Daily calculation of risk regime (Risk-On/Risk-Off) based on SYI, detection/notification of inversions, automatic overrides for peg stress, and API exposure (, , ).
7.  **Extensive UI/UX Fixes**: Resolution of multiple frontend issues including header spacing, broken buttons, page scrolling (global scroll-to-top), N/A data values, and correct volatility display format (12-60% range).
8.  **Fixing Public URL Access**: Resolution of hardcoded  URLs in the frontend to enable proper deployment and access via Emergent platform URLs.
9.  **Full Website Redesign**: Comprehensive restructuring of the entire website (Homepage, Live Index, Yield Indices, Peg Monitor, Market Insights, Methodology, API Access) with new brand tone, color palette (Blue/Gray/Red for risk coding, Orange for CTAs), updated copy, and a professional institutional look and feel.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was engaged in a comprehensive **full website redesign** for StableYield.com, following a detailed user-provided brief. This redesign involves updating the brand tone, implementing a new color palette (Blue for stability/Risk-On, Gray for neutral, Red for Risk-Off/depeg alerts, Orange for CTAs), and completely rewriting the copy and restructuring the layout for seven key pages.

So far, the following progress has been made:
1.  **Homepage Redesign**: The  and its child components like  and  have been updated with new copy (The Benchmark for Stablecoin Yields), optimized CTAs, new sections (What is SYI?, Capabilities), and the new color palette.
2.  **Live Index Dashboard Redesign**: The  and components like  and  have been redesigned. This includes a professional hero section, centralized SYI display, risk color coding (Blue/Gray/Red) for constituents and risk widgets, and sticky CTAs.
3.  **Yield Indices & Benchmarks Page Redesign**: The  has been updated with new copy (The Standard for Stablecoin Performance), capabilities, institutional applications, and closing CTAs.

The AI engineer has completed 3 out of 7 pages for the full redesign and is currently working on the **Peg Monitor Page** (), which is the next critical page for the alert system. The last action was to overwrite the existing  content using  to apply the new redesign.
