The AI engineer's work in this trajectory primarily focused on two major streams: a comprehensive website redesign and the activation/enhancement of an AI chatbot. Initial tasks involved completing the redesign of remaining pages (Peg Monitor, API Access, Market Insights, Methodology) to align with new brand guidelines and color palettes. Critical fixes were then addressed, including resolving a mixed content security error, fixing 404 routes, and rectifying functional issues with interactive elements like the peg chart, index constituents display, and dashboard tabs. A significant effort was dedicated to ensuring data consistency, particularly for FRAX pricing, by refining backend logic. Finally, the StableYield AI chatbot was fully activated and extensively enhanced, integrating , connecting to live market data, implementing proactive nudges, and incorporating a comprehensive Q&A library across the site and within the bot itself, culminating in a professional, institutional-grade digital experience.

<product_requirements>
The goal is to position StableYield.com as the Bloomberg for stablecoin yields, offering data, analytics, and market intelligence. Key requirements include:
1.  **StableYield Index Family (SYC, SY-CeFi, SY-DeFi, SY-RPI)**: Provide methodology, values, and constituents. (Initially SY100, renamed to SYC).
2.  **Real-time CeFi Yield Data**: Integrate Coinbase API, replacing mock data.
3.  **Stablecoin Peg Monitoring System**: A  package for multi-source price fetching and deviation analysis, with a Peg Monitor dashboard and Peg Status widget.
4.  **Refined StableYield Index (SYI) Calculation**: Weighted average of Risk-Adjusted Yields (RAY), with validation and API endpoints.
5.  **Risk Regime Inversion Alert Module**: Daily calculation (Risk-On/Risk-Off), inversion detection, automatic overrides for peg stress, and API exposure.
6.  **Extensive UI/UX Fixes**: Address issues like header spacing, broken buttons, global scroll-to-top, N/A data, correct volatility display, and consistent URL handling.
7.  **Full Website Redesign**: Comprehensive restructuring of seven key pages (Homepage, Live Index, Yield Indices, Peg Monitor, Market Insights, Methodology, API Access) using a new brand tone, color palette (Blue/Gray/Red, Orange for CTAs), and professional institutional look.
8.  **Activate & Enhance StableYield AI Chatbot**: Configure with LLM API key, integrate system prompt, add welcome message, quick prompts, live data integration, analytics, and prominent visual presence with specific UX/UI.
9.  **Q&A Integration**: Integrate 10 Q&A across Homepage, Market Insights, API Access pages, and the AI chatbot.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer completed the extensive task of integrating 10 Q&A (Questions & Answers) across the StableYield platform. This involved:
1.  **Bot StableYield AI**: All 10 Q&A were added to the AI chatbot's knowledge base and used as quick-prompt suggestions.
2.  **Market Insights Page ()**: The full set of 10 Q&A was added as an accordion module.
3.  **Homepage ()**: A shortened version of 3-4 key Q&A was integrated into the existing  component (), which was also updated to align with new brand colors.
The previous engineer was in the process of testing the full integration of these Q&A across the bot and the web pages.
